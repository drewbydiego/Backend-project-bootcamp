# Backend-project-bootcamp

This project is a Node.js API built using Express framework. It serves as the backend for a To-do application and connects to a SQLite database to store and retrieve data.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that provides robust routing and middleware capabilities.
- SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database engine that provides a simple and efficient way to store and manage data.

## Functionality

The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the To-do items. It follows RESTful principles to handle requests and responds with JSON data.

The main features of the API include:

- Creating new To-do items.
- Retrieving a list of all To-do items.
- Retrieving a specific To-do item by its unique identifier.
- Updating an existing To-do item.
- Deleting a To-do item.

The API utilizes SQLite as the database to store the To-do items. It leverages the power of SQL queries to interact with the database and perform the necessary operations.

## Development

During development, various npm packages and tools were used to enhance the project. These may include:

- Nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected, improving the development workflow.
- Body-parser: A middleware that parses incoming request bodies in JSON format, allowing easy access to request data.

## Future Improvements

Some potential areas for improvement and future enhancements could include:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization to secure the API endpoints.
- Adding validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and improve the user experience.
- Implementing pagination or filtering options for retrieving a subset of To-do items.
- Integrating additional databases or data stores for scalability or specific requirements.

Overall, this project provides a robust backend API for a To-do application, utilizing Node.js, Express, and SQLite to deliver efficient data management and processing capabilities.
